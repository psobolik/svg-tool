----
Use this web app to select subsets of SVG symbols from Bootstrap and/or Font Awesome sets
and then download the subset in an SVG file. 

The app displays only one of the installed SVG symbol sets at a time. You can change the 
current symbol set with the drop down. You click a symbol to add it to the selected list and 
click a symbol in the selected list to remove it. You can select symbols from different sets.
You can enter text into the filter text box to filter the list of symbols by their name.
